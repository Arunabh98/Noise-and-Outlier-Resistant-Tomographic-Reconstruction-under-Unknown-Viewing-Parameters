# Tomography-Unknown-Angles
All the scripts written during the course of this research can be found in the `scripts` folder.
* `comp_sensing.m` is used to estimate the unknown angles as well we unknown shifts. All the parameters can be found in the top of the code,
including the amount of noise. //
* `k_means_clustering.m` is used to reconstruct the image from the tomographic projections in case of 50% noise. The angles in this case are
completely unknown.
* The files in the `graph_laplacian` folder is used to reconstruct the image using the different methodology of dimensionality reduction,
using graph laplacians.

All the results associated with this research can be found in the `results` folder. The important research articles consulted during the
course of this project can be found in the `research_articles` folder.
